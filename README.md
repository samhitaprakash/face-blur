# Face Blur Tool

A real-time face anonymization app built with **OpenCV** and **Streamlit**, allowing users to blur or pixelate detected faces from webcam input with a toggle switch.

##  Project Overview

This tool offers a simple interface to protect identity during live video streaming by applying real-time face anonymization. It uses **OpenCV** for face detection and **BytesIO** for efficient in-memory image handling.

The app runs on **Streamlit**, making it easy to deploy and interact with, even without technical experience.
