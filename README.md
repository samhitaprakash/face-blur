# Face Blur Tool

A real-time face anonymization app built with **OpenCV** and **Streamlit**, allowing users to blur or pixelate detected faces from webcam input with a toggle switch.

##  Project Overview

This tool offers a simple interface to protect identity during live video streaming by applying real-time face anonymization. It uses **OpenCV** for face detection and **BytesIO** for efficient in-memory image handling.

The app runs on **Streamlit**, making it easy to deploy and interact with, even without technical experience.

##  Features

- Real-time face detection from webcam feed
- Toggle between **blur** and **pixelation** modes
- In-memory video frame handling with `BytesIO` for smoother performance
- Simple and fast GUI using Streamlit
- Capture and download snapshot of blurred/pixelated frame
